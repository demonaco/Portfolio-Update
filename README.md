# Portfolio-Update
A new take on my previous portfolio

### Technologies used:
Bootstrap, Codepen, Tachyons.io, Visual Studio Code, CSS, HTML, Unsplashed (for images)

### Summary: The assignment at hand was to update my original portfolio I created the first week or so in class. Instead of using the standard html building blocks along with simple CSS that I had learned at the time, I expanded into CSS component structures out there on the web to build a bold, beautiful, and dynamic site to showcase just how far I've come in the program. 

### I knew early on that I wanted to make the site look as modern as possible and I wanted the layout to be somewhat on the simple side, but accompanied by beautiful imagery that would give the page character so that the view would actually enjoy and have fun checking out my work and reading about who I am. In that effort I wanted to bring the viewer in almost as a friend and show them the down-to-earth person that I am. 

### Throughout component searching, I came across so many great building blocks that really sparked brainstorming for me and got the creative juices flowing. I wanted to take the reader on a journey with photos, as traveling is a big passion of mine and a part of my life, and I wanted to use copy that was personable. It's like stating "yes, I enjoy my profession, but there's still more than just that." I want the reader to leave with a take-away that feels like they almost know me!

### Steps:
1. I started looking for inspriation, as I didn't know completely which direction I wanted to head down for design. My first look was at Tachyons, as resource shared with us that I hadn't yet used. 

2. Upon looking at Tachyons component resources I loved their nav bar which I used and it showcased throughout the site. I also used their social media footer bar which displays clickable social media icons of mine.

3. The next step was to work on the "about me" page. I used one of Tachyon's album cover image cards, and replaced it with my own image, as I knew that I could have potential formatting issues if i just used a standard `<img>` tag. 

4. Tachyon also had a great resources for displaying copy that I liked, as it reads if it were from a page out of a book (going with the personable theme).

5. While perusing codepen (a resource my tutor shared with me), I fell in love with this scroll down feature that guides the reader down the page, almost telling them a story. I eventually took out the hyperlink and scroll ability features, but I filled in images that I liked along with inspirational productivity quotes as transitional pieces to each section. 

6. I configured a Bootstrap carousel, which was a lesson learned on my end, as I had to find how to fix the carousel (it initially would not going to another slide).

7. Unsplash was a great and helpful resource throughout, as the site provides amazing quality, license free images. I used these images for the carousel, and hyperlinked deployed GitHub links on them.

8. Lastly, the contact form was used from Bootstrap.

9. I also included an alternative journey throughout the site. If a reader wishes to not see the transitional images, they can simply click on a page from the nav bar to see that stand-alone page by itself.
