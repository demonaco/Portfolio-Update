                    Hey there! I'm Matt, a full stack web developer who works with multiple technologies such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, Mongo DB, React and more on a daily basis. I live in beautiful San Francisco and absolutely love traveling!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My current background is in business development. I've lead production and management of coding projects from idea to full-complete working application.
                        <br><br>I received my Bachelors of Science in Music Industry with a minor in Cinematic Arts from the <i>University of Southern California</i>, and more recently have graduated with certification in Full Stack Web Development from the <i>University of California, Berkeley</i>.
                        I've been working in tech now for the past five years and absolutely love it. I'm currently employed with a software company where I've been managing all marketing operations for the past four years.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Throughout this time I have learned the language of development by working closely with engineers and developers to find solutions to bugs, test for quality assurance purposes, and manage projects for developers to complete.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <strong>What I'll be learning next:</strong> Java, Python, and working towards fluency on my French.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        My passion is in music and technology, and my career focus is on building applications in either the audio or entertainment industry.
