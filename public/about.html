          <p>Hey there! I'm Matt, a full stack web developer who works with multiple technologies such as Javascript, HTML, CSS, Mongo DB, React and more on a daily basis. I live in beautiful San Francisco and absolutely love traveling!</p>
             
          <p>My current background is in business development. I've lead production and management of coding projects from idea to full-complete working applications.</p>
              <p>I received my Bachelors of Science in Music Industry with a minor in Cinematic Arts from the <i>University of Southern California</i>, and more recently have graduated with certification in Full Stack Web Development from the <i>University of California, Berkeley</i>.</p>
              Throughout this time I have learned the language of development by working closely with engineers and developers to find solutions to bugs, test for quality assurance purposes, and manage projects for developers to complete.
              <br>
              <br>
              <p>My passion is in music and technology, and my career focus is on building applications in either the audio or entertainment industry.</p>
        
              <strong>What I'll be learning next:</strong> Java, Python, and working towards fluency on my French.
